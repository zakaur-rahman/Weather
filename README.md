## Step: Install Dependencies

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the root directory of the "Weather" project where the `build.sh` file is located.

3. Run the following command to execute the shell script and install project dependencies:

   ```
   sh build.sh
   ```

   The `build.sh` script likely contains a series of `pip install` commands to install the required Python packages for the project.

## Step : Run the Django Server

1. After successfully installing dependencies, you'll be ready to run the Django development server.

2. In the same terminal or command prompt, navigate to the root directory of the "Weather-Server" project.

3. Run the following command to start the Django development server:

   ```
   python3 manage.py runserver
   ```

   This will start the Django server on the specified IP address and port.
